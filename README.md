Create a visual graph of your voice
1. _Save Voice sample_ lets you edit the file name so the user can set a name for the sample.
2. _Record_ records the voice.
3. _Stop_ stops the voice recording. The Record button turns into a Stop button after you push it.
4. See the image of Voice2Graph for [landscape view](https://github.com/zdavatz/voice2graph/blob/master/images/landscape.png).
5. See image for [portrait view](https://github.com/zdavatz/voice2graph/blob/master/images/portrait.png).
6. Swipe to left to show list of old samples. Like with the amk files of AmiKo.
