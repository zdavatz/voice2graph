# voice2graph
Create a visual graph of your voice
1. _Save Voice sample_ lets you edit the file name so the user can set a name for the sample.
2. _Record_ records the voice.
3. _Stop_ stops the voice recording. The Record button turns into a Stop button after you push it.
4. See the image of Voice2Graph for [landscape view](https://github.com/zdavatz/voice2graph/blob/master/images/landscape.png).
5. See image for [portrait view](https://github.com/zdavatz/voice2graph/blob/master/images/portrait.png).
6. Swipe to left to show list of old samples. Like with the amk files of AmiKo.
7. Record the pitch of the voice on an X-Axis. Plot it against time.
8. Record the intensitiy of the voice in dB. Plot against time.
9. [OverTone Analyzer](http://www.sygyt.com/de/download-mac/) does not do a bad job. But the visualisation could be better.
