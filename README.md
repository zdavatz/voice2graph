# voice2graph
Create a visual graph of your voice
1. _Save Voice sample_ lets you edit the file name so the user can set a name for the sample.
2. _Record_ records the voice.
3. _Stop_ stops the voice recording. The Record button turns into a Stop button after you push it.
4. See the image of Voice2Graph for [landscape view](https://github.com/zdavatz/voice2graph/blob/master/images/landscape.png).
5. See image for [portrait view](https://github.com/zdavatz/voice2graph/blob/master/images/portrait.png).
6. Swipe to left to show list of old samples. Like with the amk files of AmiKo.
7. Record the pitch of the voice on an X-Axis. Plot it against time. Show between 3000 and 70 Hz. See [OverTone Analyzer](http://www.sygyt.com/de/download-mac/) for visualizing the pitch against the keys of a piano.
8. Record the intensitiy of the voice in dB. Plot against time. Show between 20 and 120 dB. See [Sample](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/db-meter-noise-measure/id1136677469?mt=8).
9. Record the breaks. Many breaks or no breaks whatsoever. A break is when dB and pitch drop to zero.
10. Max. 5 minute recordings.
11. Save State of arousel to every recording from _Drop-Down_ a) high b) medium c) low
12. Print voice sample in landscape on A4. Pitch is dotted line. dB is full line. X-axis is time. Y-axis is dB and Hz. A print out in landscape mode should show max 2.5 min. So 5 minutes fit on two pages in landscape layout. Print must contain filename, timestamp and Arouse-Tag.
13. We do not want to find hidden noises. We want to display the voice over a time period of max. 5 Minutes with db and Hz.
